This folder contains examples on how to scale up GNN workflows.

We recommend the `distributed_sampling.py` example to start.

For a larger scale single-node multi-gpu (SNMG) example, try out `singlenode_multigpu_papers100m_gcn.py`.

To extend this example further to SNMG for heterogeneous data, try out `ogb_mag240m_graphsage.py`.

To extend the SNMG homogeneous example to a multi-node multi-gpu (MNMG) setting, try out `multinode_multigpu_papers100m_gcn.py`.

This folder contains other examples for exploration as well.
